Minimalistic FB messenger client

This is mostly an experiment and a challenge for myself. CLI is fun!

To use, copy config.toml.dist as config.toml, fill it out as the comments tell you to and you're good to go.

The fb library should be usable on its own, but I know of some questionable design choices I made, so expect changes.
